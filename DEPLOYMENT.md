## Deployment Steps
* Ensure you are added to the NPM Org for Lyvly
* Ensure you are logged into npm
* On `master` run `npm release:${type}` with the correct upgrade type (Major, minor, patch)
* Pray to the deity/deities you believe in. If none, pray to the nearest inanimate object.
* If you're lucky, you now have published, there is no reward, this is not kindergarten. Get back to work
